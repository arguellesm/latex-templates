# LaTeX templates :herb:

A growing collection of LaTeX templates I have created and use frequently. 

##### Setup
I use [`latexmk`](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexmk/) along with Vim and [VimTeX](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) to make things easier.

You first run `:VimtexCompile` and from then on, each `:w` will update the preview on your viewer of choice. I  personally like [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) for the clean and beautiful look.
  
##### About the templates

Both *Eggplant* and *Cloud* are assigment/article templates.
